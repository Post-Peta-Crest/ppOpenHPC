Installation procedure of ppOpen-APPL/FDM

This document describes the installation procedure of ppOpen-APPL/FDM
application for calculating propagation of elastic (seismic) wave in 2D
and 3D heterogeneous elastic media.

All of the module main program for 2D and 3D and tools provided for the
ppOpen-APPL/FDM is written in F90. 2D program runs sequentially and 3D
application runs parallel computer with suitable MPI library.

1) Extracting the ppOpen-APPL/FDM
This .tar.gz compress file contains 2D and 3D applications, examples,
documents and tools in subdirectory
 
	% tar xzvf ppohFDM_0.3.0.tar.gz

2) Check and modify Makefile
Please check and modify Makefile variables in according to your
environment of F90 compiler and MPI library.

F90
Fortran compiler

3) Make
Copy necessary parameter files of ./examples/seismic_2D-example or
./examples/seismic_3D-example in ./src directory and type 'make' and run.

(2D application)
Type 'make seism2d' in ./ top directory for the 2D application
     	% make seism2d

(3D application without the ppOpen-MATH/VIS)
Type 'make seism3d-parallel' in ./ top directory for the 3D application
without the ppOpen-MATS/VIS. User change the type of parallel (pure MPI processing and 
MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallel computing) in ./src/3.parallel/Makefile.in.

     	% make seism3d-parallel

(3D application with the ppOpen-MATH/VIS)
Type 'make seism3d-ppohVIS' in ./ top directory for the 3D application with
the ppOpen-MATH/VIS. Note that you need to read the ppOpen-MATH/VIS library.

        % make
	% make install
	% make seism3d-ppohVIS
	% make install

(3D application with the ppOpen-MATH/MP)
User needs to be compiled four applications that are "JCup", "ppOpen-MATH/MP",
"FrontISTR++" and "Seism3D+". "JCup", "ppOpen-MATH/MP", "FrontISTR" are in ppohMATH-MP-lib.
Moreover, "Seism3D+" is in ./src/seismic_3D/2.ppohFDM-ppohMP. Seism3D+ is implemented the ppohMATH-MP-lib.

4) Run
You can be run in the 2D and 3D applications in ./src/seismic_2D or sub directory of ./src/seismic_3D
