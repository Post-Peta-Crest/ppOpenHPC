Overview:
ppohBEM is software used to support a boundary element analysis executed
on a parallel computer. The directory "src/framework" includes framework
 for the boundary element analysis. The files included in 
 "src/framework_with_templates" support a surface charge method based on
  the boundary element method.

Introduction:
  This file is part of ppohBEM.
  ppohBEM is a free software application, you can use it under the terms
  of The MIT License (MIT). See LICENSE file and User's guide for more
  details.

  This software is one of the results of the "ppOpen-HPC: Open Source
  Infrastructure for Development and Execution of Large-Scale Scientific
  Applications on Post-Peta-Scale Supercomputers with Automatic Tuning
  (AT)" project.

How to try our software:

 1. Copy all files under 
    ppohBEM_0.4.0/bem-bb-framework_dense/src/framework_with_templates/
    to user's arbitrary directory.

 2. Compile and link all source files (Fortran90) with MPI library and an
    option for OpenMP
    (1) Modify 'Makefile' to adapt to your computational environment.
        (Currently, we have confirmed the compilation by Intel Fortran 
         compiler)
    (2) Complile ppohBEM with a template for the surface charge method.
        $>  cd ./
        $>  make    -> bem-bb-SCM.out

 3. Run it with MPI library.
        $>  cd ./
        $>  mpirun -np 8 ./bem-bb-SCM.out input_sample.pbf (or corresponding operations)

 4. Find a file named 'sample.output.vtk' in the current directory.
    The code 'bem-bb-SCM.out' output the file if it is successfully
    carried out.
    You can view the result by using a visualization software
    'paraview'.

software, please read the file 'User's manual_ppohBEM_0.4.0.pdf' under
