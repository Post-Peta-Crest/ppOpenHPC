	[ Version 1.00 ]
	HEC-MW is inherited all resouces from HPC-MW. The new version is 1.00.
	This version can be executed on a computer without MPI and
	on Windows' environment with or without MPI.

	[ Version 2.00 ]
	In this version, the library of coupling interface is newly available. For 
	existing libraries, several new features were added, and some bugs were 
	fixed.

	* Parallel Visualization Library
	- Parallel Streamline (PST) was newly available.

	* Coupling Interface Library [New Feature]
	- This library provides mesh mapping and interpolation between two programs.
	  According to this library, it becomes possible to perform loose coupling 
	  between two programs.

	[ Version 1.00 ]
	In this version, the libraries of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and dynamic
	load balancing (DLB) are newly available. For the exsiting libraries, 
	including, I/O, linear solvers and parallel visualizer, several new features
	were added, and some bugs were fixed.

	* I/O and Common Library
	- Output routine for log data was changed so that every process outputs a 
	  log file.
	- Interface to the visualizer was changed.
	- File format for distributed mesh was changed.
	- New members were added to the structure for mesh data.
	- !CONNECTIVITY is being newly supported in the HPC-MW entire mesh data.
	- It became possible to specify the name of HPC-MW control file at the
	  initialization routine.

	* Parallel Linear Solver Library
	- Subroutines "hpcmw_matvec_11", "hpcmw_matvec_22" and "hpcmw_matvec_33" for
	  calculating matrix-vector product were added.
	- Subroutines "hpcmw_allreduce_R" and "hpcmw_allreduce_I" for global 
	  communication were modified.

	* Parallel Visualization Library
	- Some 2nd-order element types are now supported.
	- It became possible to create deformation image.
	- Problems underlying multiple element types were fixed.

	* Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Library [New Feature]
	- This library provides parallel adaptive mesh refinement for 1st-order 
	  tetrahedral and triangular elements.

	* Dynamic Load Balancing (DLB) Library [New Feature]
	- This library creates distributed mesh data which balance the load of 
	  every process by repartitioning.
