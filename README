1. Descriptions

ppOpen-APPL/FEM (ppohFEM) is a middleware to allow a Finite Element 
Method (FEM) analysis code developer to devote himself to development of 
the application software by offering a function commonly used in FEM. 

Contents of this package is described in User's guide, 
doc/ppohFEM_users_guide.pdf
Reference manual for APIs provided by middleware is described in 
Reference manual, doc/ppohFEM_reference_manual.pdf

The codes are written in C and Fortran

   ./app_flow         : Example fluid dynamics application program using 
                        ppohFEM library.
   ./app_heat         : Example heat transfer application program using 
                        ppohFEM library.
   ./app_struct       : Example structural analysis program using 
                        ppohFEM library
   ./doc              : Document files of ppohFEM library. 
   ./etc              : Example Makefile.in file to define system 
                        depend settings.
   ./ppohFEM          : Source code of ppohFEM library.

3 How to compile

This software requires the following developer tools and libraries to be  
available for use in the build procedure.
 A Fortran compiler
 A C compiler
 A MPI library
 The METIS4.0.3 library

Edit the file Makefile.in that resides in the same directory as this file
according to the requirements of your system. In particular you may need
to modify the following: 

1. The CC variable, to be the name of C compiler in your system. 
2. The F90 variable, to be the name of Fortran compiler in your system. 

After saving the modified Makefile.in, type 'make' at the prompt. 

This will build 
ppohFEM/lib/libppohFEM.a  : library file which contain functions 
                            provided by this library. 
app_struct/bin/app_struct : sample program which perform 
                            static linear analysis.
app_heat/bin/app_heat     : sample program which perform heat transfer.
app_flow/bin/app_flow     : sample program which perform fluid dynamics.

4. Installation Instructions

(1) Modify 'Makefile.in'. samples for Intel and FX10 compiler are avilable.
  etc/Makefile.in.FX10  : Fujitsu FX10
  etc/Makefile.in.linux : Ordinary linux

(2) Complile ppOpen-APPL
 $>  make  -> ppohFEM/lib/libppohFEM.a & app_struct/bin/app_struct
              & app_heat/bin/app_heat


(3) Run the sample code
 $>  cd ./app_struct/test01
 $>  mpirun -np 4 ../bin/app_struct

 $>  cd ./app_heat/test
 $>  mpirun -np 4 ../bin/app_heat

(4) Clean
 $>  cd ./
 $>  make distclean      -> Clean all library, objects and executable
