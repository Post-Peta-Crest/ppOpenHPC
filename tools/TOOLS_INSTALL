Installation procedure of ppOpen-APPL/FDM visualization tools for 2D
and 3D wavefield

This document describes how to use visualization tools to illustrate
snapshots and waveform output of the ppOpen-APPL/FDM program for 2D and
3D model

(a) tools_2D
Visualization tool for 2D wavefield contains 
 ppmxy2d.f90: to make image (ppm format) of snapshots of seismic wave
              field

 rwav2d.f90: to convert to gnuplot format

these programs use the following modules:
m_daytim.f90, m_endian.f90, m_getopt.f90, m_number1.f90, m_ppm.f90,
m_readprm.f90, m_system.f90

Instrations: 
Type 'make' to create  ppmxy2d and rwav2d

% make

(b)tools_3D
Visualization tool for 3D wavefield contains contains 

 catsnap.f90:  to combine a set of separated snapshots created by
               parallel simulation into a single snapshot file

 ppmxy3d3.f90: to make image (ppm format) of snapshots of seismic
               wave field

 catwav.f90:  to combine a set of separated waveform output created
              by parallel simulation into a single waveform file

 rwav3d.f90 : to make waveform in ascii format

these programs can be compiled with the m_stdio module.

Instrations: 
Type 'make' to create  catsnap, catwav and rwav3d

% make
